Jack came to IBM business systems from the GNU free software community and not the other way around like most people in the IBM business system space. He went from Cygnus Support (later part of Red Hat) to contracting at IBM where he got to know mainframes. Then in 1997 he started working at another company that had AS/400 and discovered that IBM provides an open source Java library called JTOpen for remote controlling AS/400 (nowadays called IBM i).

That got him going on IBM i an is still a contributor to that project to this day.
He wrote several open source projects targeted at mainframe and IBM i
The most complete one is [Ublu](https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu).
